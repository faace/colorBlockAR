# Color Blocks AR
Hi, It is time to bring out your dusted Hiro marker to enjoy this game. :)
How:
1. Use your web brower(chrome) on you smart phone to open the link below:
https://faace.github.io/colorBlockAR/
2. permit the web to use you camera
3. scan the Hiro marker
4. Enjoy the game

Rule:
1. Fuse a color block for about 1 second to let the block extend as it could
2. extend all the color blocks one by one(even though one hasn't space to extend).
3. You will win if all the hollow cell is filled
